# Mewtwo - Risk Dataframe
Authors: Ahmed Aljeshi | Juan Francisco Balbi | Paula Escusol Entio | Isobel Rae Impas | Paliz Mungkaladung
<br>
<br>This package contains a python class called Risk Dataframe which contains methods to perform a missing not at random analysis and to automate a risk-based segmentation process by analyzing all the features in the dataset and identifying the best split for segmenting each feature.
